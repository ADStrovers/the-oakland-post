The Oakland Post App
====================

The mobile companion for [The Oakland Post](http://www.oaklandpostonline.com)
website.

Conventions

### Issues
Each issue is assigned exactly three labels of the form
**(severity, type, component)**:

    severity  = major | minor .
    type      = bug | enhancement | feature .
    component = global | home | sections | photos | blogs | info | login .
    
### Commits
I follow the recommendations from the [Git book], e.g.

`Home: heighten rows and add placeholder date label`
